## Use cases
1. Re-engage users whoâ€™ve abandoned a funnel: Trigger re-engagement messaging when users abandon the purchase or subscription funnel
2. Personalize the trial experience: Identify friction points in your trial experience and send correctly timed reminders to re-engage users during a trial and help them get to value
3. Drive higher engagement on announcements and offers: Target promotions, updates, and new service announcements to the relevant audiences

## Data import integration

Use the Heap to Braze integration in order to automatically sync data from Braze Currents to Heap. 

### Step 1: Get the Braze data import key

In Braze, click on **Technology Partners** and then select Heap. On this page you can find your data import key as well as a REST Endpoint. Take note of both of these values and provide them to your Heap account manager to finish setting up the integration. 

### Step 2: Segment imported users in Braze

In Braze, navigate to **Segments** under **Engagement** and click "Create Segment". After providing a name and optional description to your segment, click "Create Segment" again. On the segment details page, you can add a new filter and select "Heap Cohorts" followed by whichever Heap segment you would like to track.

## Data export integration

Use the Braze Currents in order to automatically sync data from a Heap segment to an equivalent Braze Cohort. 

### Step 1: Get Heap Credentials

You'll need a webhook endpoint URL in order to configure this integration, which you can get from your Heap account manager.

### Step 2: Configure Braze Currents

In Braze, navigate to **Currents** in the **Integrations** section, click "Create New Current", and then select "Custom Currents Export". Give your export a name and then proceed to the Current Details page. On this page, you'll need to enter the endpoint and optional bearer token (if provided) in the Credentials section.

After you've configured your integration's credentials, select all message engagement events as well as customer behavior and user events that you would like to export to Heap, and then click "Update Current".
